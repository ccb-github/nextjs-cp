#Here are the steps:

    First, you need to create a new Realm app and specify the authentication providers that you want to use. After creating a Realm app, you can access the MongoDB Realm dashboard, where you can enable authentication providers, such as Google, Facebook, and Apple. For more information, you can refer to the Realm Web documentation.

    To use the Next.js Auth Session library, you need to install it first. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    python

```npm install next-auth```

After installing Next.js Auth Session, you need to configure it in your Next.js app. This involves creating a file named [...nextauth].js in your pages/api/auth directory. This file should contain the following code:

javascript
```
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import Providers from 'next-auth/providers';

export default NextAuth({
  // Configure one or more authentication providers
  providers: [
    Providers.Google({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
  ],

  // Optional SQL or MongoDB database to persist users
  // database: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
});
```
This code specifies that you want to use Google as your authentication provider and that you will be providing your Google Client ID and Client Secret as environment variables.

Once you have configured Next.js Auth Session, you can use it in your app by including the following code in your pages:

javascript
```
import { signin, signout, useSession } from 'next-auth/client';

// ...

const [session, loading] = useSession();

if (loading) {
  return <p>Loading...</p>;
}

if (!session) {
  return <>
    <p>You are not signed in</p>
    <button onClick={() => signin()}>Sign in</button>
  </>;
}

return <>
  <p>Welcome, {session.user.name}!</p>
  <button onClick={() => signout()}>Sign out</button>
</>;
```
